My First Dynamic Website

This is my first attempt at building a dynamic website. It was a learning experience and, while functional, it has several areas that need improvement.

Project Overview
This website is built using HTML, CSS, PHP, JS, MYSQLI. It dynamically handles content but there are some shortcomings that I plan to improve.

Known Issues
Lack of proper file organization: Files are scattered and not organized in a proper folder structure.
Inconsistent image naming conventions: Some image files have unclear or inconsistent names.
File extensions: In certain cases, I used incorrect or inconsistent file extensions.
Code readability: The code lacks comments and proper formatting.

Contributing
As this is my first project, feedback and suggestions are welcome!
